# Sorting algorithms & Big O 

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or data structure elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of element in the respective data structure.

## CONTENT

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c) :blue_heart:
* Is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* [0-O](./0-O) - The big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm.

### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c) :poultry_leg:
* Is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages.
* [1-O](./1-O) -  The big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm.
    
### [2. Selection sort ](./2-selection_sort.c) :clap:
*  Is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort.
*  [2-0](./2-O) -  The big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm 

### [3. Quicksort](3-quick_sort.c) :star: :star: :star: 
*  Is an efficient sorting algorithm. Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting.
* [3-O](./3-O) - The big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm

### [4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence](100-shell_sort.c) :shell:
* Also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared.


### [5. Cocktail shaker sort](./101-cocktail_sort_list.c) :tropical_drink:
* Also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort (which can also refer to a variant of selection sort), ripple sort, shuffle sort,or shuttle sort, is an extension of bubble sort. The algorithm extends bubble sort by operating in two directions. While it improves on bubble sort by more quickly moving items to the beginning of the list, it provides only marginal performance improvements.
* [101-O](./101-O) - The big O notations of the time complexity of the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm

### [6. Counting sort](./102-counting_sort.c) :hear_no_evil:
*  Is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items.
*  [102-O](./102-O) - The big O notations of the time complexity of the Counting sort algorithm
